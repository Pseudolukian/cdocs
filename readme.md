# About  

**CDOCS** is a single-file executable program for generating HTML documentation from `.md` files. Its key advantages:  

1. **Lightweight** â€“ Just one file. That's all you need to build HTML documentation.  
2. **Faster** than modern documentation systems based on JS or Python.  

## Implemented features  

1. Variable parsing in text.  
2. Configuration via a config file.  
3. Asynchronous file parsing.  

## In progress  

1. Implementing an include system for `.md` files.  
2. Adding conditional logic in `.md` files.

## In plans

- Add fast lint file check before build and preview

# About  

**CDOCS** is a simple infrastructure for preprocessing Markdown, converting `.md` files into HTML, and providing a WebUI for collaborative documentation work.  

**Key Features**:  
1. **Lightweight** â€“ Just one file. That's all you need to build HTML documentation.  
2. **Faster** than modern documentation systems based on JS or Python.  

## Implemented Features  

### Variables

Using `{{ var_name }}` template for add vars in the `.md`. Vars split by the group: default group -- main, other groups ...

### Inline if conditions

### Block if conditions

### Block include

## Planned Improvements  
  
- Develop an MD-to-HTML converter.

## Performance Optimization Plan  

1. Split variables into groups (maps).  
2. Implement a `swap` file.  
3. Implement a `threadpool`.
